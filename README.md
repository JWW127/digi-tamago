## What is it?
DigiTamago is a virtual pet style game. The game is in the form of a Chrome Extension and is written in vanilla javaScript HTML and CSS. This project is unique because it is a chrome extension which can be accessed via Chrome browser's tool bar.

## Why?
This was basically just a test to see if I could create a game as a chrome extension. Just something cool and fun, that doesn't require you have a powerful graphics card.

### Dependencies
None aside from a Chrome browser, you'll have to turn on dev mode and go to chrome://extensions, then "load unpacked" the downloaded repo.
